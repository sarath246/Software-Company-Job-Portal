<h1>Aptitude Test</h1>

<br/><br/>
<p>The aptitude test consists of four sections and total time allotted is 90 minutes. It includes Quantitative<br/> Aptitude, Programming Language Efficiency, Coding Test and E-mail Writing. Be especially careful while<br/> attempting the email questions as that is a key elimination round. See that you follow the precise instructions<br/> while attempting the question.

<br/><br/>
<h1>Technical Interview</h1>

<br/><br/>
<p>
This round is based on your resume, branch of specialization, favorite subjects, etc. Be prepared to answer basic questions<br/> relating to each of these topics. Don’t be surprised if you are asked to write code. Also be ready to answer puzzle questions.<br/> In certain cases, the interviewer may also try and confuse/mislead you into giving the wrong answer so watch out for such<br/> trick questions.
</p>
<br/><br/>
<h1>Managerial Interview</h1>

<br/><br/>
<p>
A lot depends on your interviewer in this round.<br/> You could either be asked general technical and HR <br/>questions, or it could be a pressure interview to gauge<br/> your reactions. Achievements mentioned in your CV  <br/>could be questioned, and you may need to defend them.<br/> Alternatively, you could be asked general questions about <br/>your work experience, college degree, specialization,<br/> willingness to relocate, etc. In any case,never fail to be<br/> gracious irrespective of which direction the interview takes.

</p>
<br/><br/>
<h1>HR Interview</h1>

<br/><br/>
<p>
Expect questions on work experience, education, hobbies and<br/> family background apart from the usual HR questions like <br/>strengths and weaknesses, reasons for applying to the <br/>company, why you should be hired, etc. Most candidates tend to<br/> think that the HR interview is easy, but remember that a bad HR <br/>interview could end your chances of getting the job even after <br/>passing all the previous obstacles (aptitude test, technical <br/>round, etc.). The key here is to remain polite and confident.<br/> Interviews can be long and dreary so don’t forget to wear a<br/> smile!<br/><br/>
With TCS being named one of the world’s top employers by the <br/>Top Employer Institute for consecutive years, a career at this <br/>company could be rich and rewarding experience for job<br/> seekers. So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and apply now!
